	<strong><u><font size="5" face="Verdana">2013 Gun Appreciation Day – High 
	Capacity Steel Fun Shoot – January 19th 2013, 9:30 AM</font></u></strong></div>
<div>
	<font face="Verdana">There will be three different ‘stages’ for your 
	shooting enjoyment!</font></div>
<ul>
	<ol>
		<li><font face="Verdana">We will have a <strong>‘Man-on-Man’ steel shoot</strong>. 
		This will be single elimination. This will be <u>centerfire</u> pistol 
		only, 9mm and above. There will be a number of steel falling targets, 
		and a ‘crossover popper’ which will determine the winner of each 
		pairing. <strong>Entry fee $5</strong>. We may even do it more than 
		once, if time allows. <u>Remember, this is for fun!</u> </font></li>
		<li><font face="Verdana"><strong>High Capacity Steel Challenge Stage</strong>. 
		This will be like a regular steel stage, but there will be 12 or so 
		targets! (hence the high capacity....) These are not reactive targets, 
		so we will have divisions for centerfire, and rimfire. All centerfire 
		will be lumped together. All rimfire (rifle and pistol) will be lumped 
		together. Only two divisions – centerfire and rimfire. period. <u>
		Remember, this is for fun.</u> <strong>Entry Fee – $2 per (2) runs</strong>, 
		best time counts. We will keep running people until we get tired, or 
		just can’t take it anymore! We will run our Big Display Board timer, so 
		everyone can keep an eye on what the times are, even if they are hiding 
		in the warm clubhouse!</font></li>
		<li><font face="Verdana"><strong>.223 Rifle Steel speed stage</strong> – 
		AR15’s are on everybody’s mind right now, so we thought we would make a 
		place for them. We will setup a handful of steel targets out to 100 
		yards, which will be engaged with .223 rifle ONLY. <strong>Entry Fee – 
		$2 per (2) runs</strong>, best time counts. <u>Did I mention – this is 
		for FUN!</u></font></li>
	</ol>

	<font face="Verdana">Notes:</font></div>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Verdana">All start positions will be LOW READY, no holster 
	draws. Works better with winter coats.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">Yes, all different guns are lumped together, other 
	than rimfire on stage 2 – why? This is just for fun!!</font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">PLEASE bring a friend, they will have fun!</font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">What are we going to do with the money? We are 
	going to have a list of a few organizations that the we will choose from to 
	send the money. We will take a vote, each participant gets one vote. List to 
	be determined...</font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana"><strong>If you want to bring some food along to 
	share with the group – please feel free! I don’t care what it is, as long as 
	you want to bring it!</strong></font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">don’t have a .223 rifle??? Hmmmm..... bring some 
	factory ammo, and I am certain you will find one that someone will loan you 
	to shoot!</font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">What do the winners get? Drum roll 
	please......BRAGGING RIGHTS! </font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">We will try to have some tarps on hand to help
